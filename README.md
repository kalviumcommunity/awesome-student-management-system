# Awesome Student Management System

This is a simple Python project that demonstrates Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts, specifically classes and objects, and the use of the "this" pointer in Python.

## Project Overview

The project includes two main files:

1. `student.py`: This file defines a `Student` class, representing individual students, and showcases the use of classes and objects.

2. `main.py`: This file contains a simple program that creates instances of the `Student` class and demonstrates the use of the "this" pointer within class methods.
